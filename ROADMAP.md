## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality and CLI

**Goal**: Create a functional command-line tool (`projgen`) that generates project structures based on a YAML configuration.

1. **Setup Project Environment**

   - Set up the Dart project and repository for `projgen`.
   - Create the initial directory structure for the project, including the necessary folders (e.g., `bin`, `lib`, `test`) and files (e.g., `pubspec.yaml`, `README.md`).

2. **Implement YAML Parsing**

   - Develop the code to read and parse the `projgen.yaml` configuration file.
   - Ensure that the tool can handle different YAML structures and configurations.

3. **Generate Project Structure**

   - Create the logic to generate the project structure based on the parsed YAML configuration.
   - Ensure that the tool creates folders and files according to the specified hierarchy.

4. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Implement the command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the tool.
   - Add command options, such as `--structure` to trigger the structure generation.

### Phase 2: Installation and Documentation

**Goal**: Improve installation and provide clear documentation for users.

5. **Package Publishing**

   - Prepare the package for publication to the Dart pub repository.
   - Update the `pubspec.yaml` file with the correct metadata and dependencies.

6. **Installation Instructions**

   - Update the README with detailed installation instructions.
   - Mention how users can install Dart SDK if not already installed.
   - Include examples of the installation command for different platforms.

7. **Usage Instructions**

   - Enhance the README with clear usage instructions for each command option.
   - Include examples and explanations for generating the project structure.

8. **Sample Demo Project**
   - Create a sample demo project that users can explore to understand the tool's capabilities better.
   - Include a pre-configured `projgen.yaml` file in the demo project.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Customization

**Goal**: Add advanced features to provide more flexibility and customization.

9. **Custom File Templates**

   - Enable users to define custom file templates in the YAML configuration.
   - Allow specifying placeholders that will be replaced with actual values during generation.

10. **Optional Features**

    - Implement a mechanism to enable or disable certain features or directories based on the YAML configuration.
    - Make it possible for users to have more control over the generated structure.

11. **Validation and Error Handling**
    - Enhance the error handling and validation mechanisms in the tool.
    - Provide meaningful error messages to help users understand and fix issues with their YAML configuration.

### Phase 4: Community Engagement and Feedback

**Goal**: Encourage community involvement and gather feedback for improvement.

12. **Contributing Guidelines**

    - Include a CONTRIBUTING.md file to guide potential contributors on how to contribute to the project.
    - Clearly state the process for creating issues, submitting pull requests, and code review expectations.

13. **Bug Fixes and Improvements**

    - Address and fix reported bugs and issues promptly.
    - Regularly release new versions with improvements based on user feedback.

14. **Community Support**

    - Engage with the community through forums, chat platforms, and social media.
    - Offer support and answer questions related to `projgen`.

15. **Documentation Improvements**
    - Continuously improve the documentation based on user feedback and frequently asked questions.

### Phase 5: Additional Platforms and Integrations

**Goal**: Extend support for other platforms and integrate with popular frameworks.

16. **Flutter Integration**

    - Test and ensure compatibility with Flutter projects.
    - Update the documentation to include Flutter-specific instructions.

17. **Other Language Support**

    - Investigate and add support for other programming languages and ecosystems (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Go).

18. **IDE Integration**
    - Explore the possibility of creating plugins or extensions for popular IDEs (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ) to provide seamless integration with `projgen`.

### Phase 6: Performance and Efficiency

**Goal**: Optimize the tool for better performance and efficiency.

19. **Performance Analysis**

    - Analyze the tool's performance, identify bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.

20. **Parallel Generation**

    - Explore the possibility of parallelizing the structure generation process to improve speed.

21. **Caching Mechanism**
    - Implement a caching mechanism to avoid unnecessary re-generation of unchanged files.

### Phase 7: Continuous Integration and Deployment

**Goal**: Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline for the project.

22. **Continuous Integration**

    - Set up a CI pipeline to run automated tests on every pull request and commit.
    - Ensure that the codebase meets quality standards before merging.

23. **Automated Releases**

    - Implement an automated release process to publish new versions to the Dart pub repository.

24. **Version Management**
    - Decide on a versioning strategy and follow semantic versioning principles.

### Phase 8: Long-term Maintenance

**Goal**: Ensure the long-term maintenance and sustainability of the project.

25. **Maintainer Onboarding**

    - Welcome new maintainers to the project and provide them with the necessary information.

26. **Long-term Support**

    - Plan and commit to providing long-term support for the tool.

27. **Updates and Security Patches**

    - Stay up-to-date with the latest Dart and platform changes and release updates and security patches accordingly.

28. **Community Growth**
    - Continue fostering the community and attracting new contributors and users.
